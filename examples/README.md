## Build

After installing Gazebo Plugin, from source or from binaries, build with:

cd ign-plugin/examples
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

### Ubuntu and MacOS

```bash
make
```

Two executables are created inside the `build` folder for each example.

You can run each executable from the build folder with `./executablename`. For example:
