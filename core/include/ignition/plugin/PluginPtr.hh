    /// This class behaves similarly to a std::shared_ptr where multiple
    /// PluginPtr objects can share a single plugin instance, and the plugin
    /// instance will not be deleted until all PluginPtr objects that refer to
    /// it are either destroyed, cleared, or begin referring to a different
    /// plugin instance.
    ///
    /// A PluginPtr object can be "cast" to a SpecializedPluginPtr object by
    /// simply using the copy/move constructor or assignment operator of a
    /// SpecializedPluginPtr object. Note that this "cast" does have a small
    /// amount of overhead associated with it, but it may result in huge savings
    /// after initialization is finished if you frequently access the interfaces
    /// that the SpecializedPluginPtr is specialized for.
